# Introduction with the Titanic Dataset
This is the first Machine Learning/Data Science dataset I have worked on. I have tried about 7-8 different ML algorithms, 
after processing on the dataset, and then listed them down with decreasing order of training set accuracy. 
After this I have used the Decision Tree to reach a test set accuracy of 79.94% which is in the top 14% of the Kaggle
leaderboard. (As of 9th September 2018, I am ranked 1370 out of about 9860 contestants.)
This was my first attempt, and I am gladly accepting ideas, and contributions to make this even better. I will add
commentary to the juptyr notebook in a few weeks time, explaining what I have done. To most people who fiddled with any data set
before, this should be more or less self-explanatory already.
